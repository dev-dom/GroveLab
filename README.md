# GroveLab
This repo will host Arduino code created for Grove Shield and Grove sensors (my experiments with IoT).
I assume that you already have an Arduino board, Grove Shield and sensors to use with the Shield.
If not, I would recommend to start from here:  http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove_System .
A good beginner kit is the Grove Starter Kit (http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove_-_Starter_Kit_v3#Grove_-_Base_Shield).
Many of my lab examples use the sensors in the Grove Starter Kit and they are based on the sample code provided with the kit.
If you have any question or wish to report a bug in my code, please send me an e-mail to devdom4g@gmail.com
Happy Coding!
